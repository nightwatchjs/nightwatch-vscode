## Requirements

This extension works with [Nightwatch JS][nightwatch] version v2.3.4+

## Easy Installation

The extension will be auto-activated if you have a `nightwatch.conf.js` file. You can also add it manually with the Install Nightwatch action. The installation guide will ask you for your choice of browsers to be installed.

## Run and Debug your tests

Run single or multiple tests from your sidebar or with the Run command. Easily debug your tests by setting up a breakpoint.
